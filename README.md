# AzurLaneData

This repository holds the lua scripts of every Azur Lane client. Updates should be pushed autmatically a few minutes after they're live. 

Thanks are appreciated, as this hogs a lot of resources out of my server...

No, I won't help you cheat in the game. I won't take your fucking money in exchange for the scripts or lua decryption. I won't tell you how to fucking decrypt them either. Stop coming for your cheats purpose or out of interest and play legit like everyone else is doing instead of ruining the game for the others. Because there won't be a next time.
