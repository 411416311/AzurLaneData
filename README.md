# AzurLaneData

This repository holds the lua scripts of every Azur Lane client. Updates should be pushed autmatically a few minutes after they're live. Thanks are appreciated, as this hogs a lot of resources out of my server... 

Imagine making stupid theories that I hold the scripts hostage when the repository isn't updated. Maybe... you know, I don't think I owe anyone keeping the tool online on my server that takes 3/4 of its resources that I AM paying for. For something that I don't even use myself and that I don't even get a "thanks" for. You know, decompiling all the files especially weapon_property takes up to 2GB of RAM which sometimes ends killing some other processes I have running on my server (and that are FAR higher priority than this) and then the tool kills itself too because out of RAM but I guess it's easy to make dumb theories. At this point maybe it's better I shut it down and people go and do it on their own.

And no, I won't help you cheat. So fuck off. Stop making it harder for actual contributors.
