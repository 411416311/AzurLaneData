# AzurLaneData

This repository holds the lua scripts of every Azur Lane client.

Updates should be pushed here within a few minutes. If it missed an update please let me know so I can fix it, it's either that or the patch didn't change scripts. Thanks are appreciated, as this takes a lot of resources of my server. :)

**NOTE:** Repository is back up. Script is more half assed than ever but should do for now until I get motivation.
